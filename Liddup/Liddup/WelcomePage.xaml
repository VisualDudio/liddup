        <!--This is the page the app starts in, it will probably have just a Host button and a Join button. The other alternative is
        to have a Host button and then a list of nearby playlists a user can join. If you choose the former, we need an additional
        Content Page titled something like "NearbyPlaylistsPage". Also it would be nice to call the 'playlists' something less verbose.
        
        Note: All navigation will be done in the code-behind
        
        The navigation flow should be: WelcomePage -> CreateRoomPage (if user clicks Host) | MasterPlaylistPage (if user clicks a nearby playlist)
        -> MusicServicesPage (if user clicks the 'add songs' button) -> UserPlaylistsPage (if user clicks a music provider)
        -> MasterPlaylistPage (if user clicks 'add to master playlist' button)-->
